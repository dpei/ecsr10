\description{
A dataset containing ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes that are exempt from Present on 
Admission (POA) indicator requirements. These codes represent conditions that are 
always considered present on admission regardless of POA indicator values.
}
\details{
POA exempt codes include conditions that:
\itemize{
  \item Are always considered present on admission by clinical definition
  \item Cannot be acquired during a hospital stay  
  \item Are chronic conditions that existed before admission
  \item Are congenital conditions or birth defects
  \item Are external cause codes (accidents, injuries)
}

Version mapping follows CMS guidelines:
\itemize{
  \item Version 33: 2015 Q4 - 2016 Q3
  \item Version 34: 2016 Q4 - 2017 Q3  
  \item ...continuing through...
  \item Version 42: 2024 Q4 - 2025 Q3
}
}

# Get POA exempt codes for version 42 (current)
v42_codes <- poaxmpt_codes_long[poaxmpt_codes_long$version == 42, ]
length(unique(v42_codes$code))
